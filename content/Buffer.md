A [[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|solution]] with high concentrations of a [[Acid#Weak Acid|weak acid]] and its [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs|conjugate base]] or vice versa
Equal amounts make a good buffer

**Resists changes in [[pH]] by neutralizing added [[Acid|acids]] or [[Base|bases]]**
Adding protons will convert some $A^-$ to $HA$ or $B$ to $HB^+$
Adding hydroxide [[Ions]] will convert some $HA$ to $A^-$ or $HB^+$ to $B$
# Preparation
## Method 1
[[Acid#Weak Acid|Weak acid]]/[[Base#Weak Base|weak base]] is neutralized with [[Base#Strong Base|strong base]]/[[Acid#Strong Acid|strong acid]]
Forms [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs|conjugate acid-base pair]]
Eg. $CH_3COOH$ and $NaOH$
## Method 2
[[Acid#Weak Acid|Weak acid]]/[[Base#Weak Base|weak base]] is combined with a [[Salts|salt]] containing its [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs|conjugate acid/base]]
Eg. $NH_3$ and $NH_4Cl$ or $CH_3COOH$ and $CH_3COONa$
# Range
Effective [[pH]] range for [[Buffer]]
Amount of one component of buffer must be within 10x the other, so
$|\log{\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}| \le 1$, so
[[pH]] must stay within 1 of $pK_a$
# Capacity
Amount of [[Acid]] or [[Base]] a [[Buffer]] can neutralize before [[pH]] changes by large amount
Higher concentrations of $[HA]$ and $[A^-]$ â†’ higher [[Buffer#Capacity|buffer capacity]]
When $[HA]>[A^-]$, higher capacity for added [[Base]]
When $[HA]<[A^-]$, higher capacity for added [[Acid]]
