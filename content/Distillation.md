For [[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|solution]] with different boiling points (boiling point is mix between the two)
1. Boil lower boiling point substance
2. Let condense in condenser, which cools with cold water
3. Collects in collection chamber in cold bath
# Fractional Distillation
Multiple vaporization and condensation cycles
Put surface for material to condense in tube 
# Distillation Curves
D is boiling point of lower boiling point substance, A is higher boiling point
Swap out collection between B and C to collect substances separately
