An Avogadro's number of particles
[[Atomic mass]] â†’ mass of samples
Avogadro's number: number of atoms such that $1u*N_a = 1g$
$N_a \approx 6.02214076*10^{23}\text{ mol}^{-1}$
molar mass: $\frac{g}{mol}$ (same # as [[Atomic mass]])
$mol \cdot N_a = \text{\# of atoms}$
formula units - same as calculating # of atoms or molecules ^7d6351
