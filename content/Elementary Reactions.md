**Reactions that occur in one step**
Component parts of complex reactions
Unimolecular or bimolecular
Can produce intermediates, which are produced in one step and consumed in another
# [[Rate Law|Rate Laws]]
## Unimolecular
$aA \rightarrow \text{products}$
$R=k[A]^a$
## Bimolecular
$aA+bB\rightarrow \text{products}$
$R=k[A]^a[B]^b$
## Termolecular (rare)
$aA+bB+cC \rightarrow \text{products}$
$R=k[A]^a[B]^b[C]^c$
