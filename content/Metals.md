Metallic properties
When metal is mixed with smaller element forms interstitial alloys (eg. steel made of Fe and C)
When metal is mixed with same size element forms substitutional alloys (eg. brass made of Cu and Zn)
When mixed with both, forms alloys that are both interstitial and substitutional (eg. stainless steel made of Fe, C, and Cr)
