Shells - energy levels
Subshell - sublevels of shell (2s, 2p)
2 electrons per orbital

# Aufbau Principle (order of filling):
Electrons will fill lowest energy subshell

Diagram arrows represent spin: up then down

\**d*-block not actually always filling d first
Note: Cr and Cu are odd and are $[Ar]4s^1 3d^5$ and $[Ar]4s^1 3d^{10}$ respectively
# Valence Electrons
Electrons in outermost shell
Oxygen: $1s^22s^22p^4$
2 core, 6 valence
# Ground State
Electrons fill lowest energy levels first
Compared to excited state, when electron jumps up to a different shell
# Electronic Transitions
Hit electron with photon -> electron jumps up shells
Electron jumps down shells -> emits photon
Energy difference between shells calculated with 
# Photon energy
$$ E = hv $$
$$ c = \lambda v$$
h: Planck's constant = $6.626*10^{-34}\text{ J s}$
E: energy of photon
v: frequency
$\lambda$: wavelength
c: speed of light = $2.998*10^8 \text{ m}/\text{s}$
Can be used to calculate energy difference in energy levels
