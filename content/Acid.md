Proton/$\text{H}^+$ donor
Proton goes from acid to [[Base]]
**Conjugate acid** - Has positive charge, acid formed from [[Base]] receiving proton
# Strong Acid
An acid that [[Ions|ionizes]] completely in water (forms $H_3O^+$)
Eg. $HCl$, $HBr$, $HI$, $HNO_3$, $HCIO_4$, $H_2SO_4$ (but only completely ionizes once)
# Weak Acid
Only partially [[Ions|ionize]] in water
[[Equilibrium Constant]] < 1 (more reactants than products)
$K_a$: [[Equilibrium Constant]] when reacted with water
% [[Ions|ionization]]: $$ \frac{[H_3O^+]_{eq}}{[HA]_{init}} $$
## 5% Rule
If % [[Ions|ionization]] < 5%, then you can approximate $[H_3O^+]$ by assuming it's << $[HA]$
# Strength Factors
## [[Bonds|Bond]] [[Polarity]] H-A
Increase → [[#Strong Acid|stronger acid]]
## [[Bonds|Bond]] Strength H-A
Increase → [[#Weak Acid|weaker acid]]
## [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs|Conjugate Base]] Stability
Increase → [[#Strong Acid|stronger acid]]
