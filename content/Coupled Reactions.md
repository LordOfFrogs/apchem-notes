$$ A + B \rightleftharpoons C+i \qquad \Delta G^\circ > 0, K < 1 $$
$$ i + D \rightleftharpoons E+F \qquad \Delta G^\circ \ll 0, K \gg 1 $$
Combined: $$ A+B+D \rightleftharpoons C+E+F \qquad \Delta G^\circ < 0, K>1$$
$\Delta G^\circ$: [[Gibbs Free Energy]]
K: [[Equilibrium Constant]]

The 1st reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, but when coupled with the 2nd reaction, the combined reaction will be thermodynamically favorable
Goal is to produce C
2nd reaction uses the $i$ fast, so the 1st reaction must run forward to maintain equilibrium, producing C
