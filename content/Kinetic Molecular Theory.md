Models gas as particles with following assumptions:
A gas consists of particles in constant, random motion
The combined volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume in which the gas is contained
The particles exert no attractive or repulsive forces on each other
Collisions between particles are completely elastic
The average kinetic energy of the particles is proportional to the Kelvin temperature

Temperature follows [[Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution]]
# Models [[Ideal Gas Law]]:
Pressure - elastic collisions against container

## $P \propto \frac1{V}$
Less volume - more particles hitting container
## $P \propto T$
More velocity - more particles hitting container
