The potential/voltage of a cell ([[Galvanic Cell]] or [[Electrolytic Cell]]) when all reactants and products are in their [[Standard States]]
$$
\Huge E^{\circ}_{cell} = E^{\circ}_{red}+ E^{\circ}_{ox} = E^{\circ}_{red} (\substack{\text{reduction}\\ \text{process}}) - E^{\circ}_{red} (\substack{\text{oxidation}\\ \text{process}})
$$
Voltage is intensive property - doesn't depend on amount of substance
# Finding [[Gibbs Free Energy]]
$$
\LARGE \Delta G=-nFE
$$
$\Delta G$: [[Gibbs Free Energy]] difference
n: number of electrons transferred
F: Faraday's Constant
E: potential/voltage
> [!info]
> Faraday's Constant is the electric charge per [[Moles|mole]] of elementary charges
> $$ = 96,485 \frac{\text{C}}{\text{mol e}^{-}} $$
> C is a [[Coulomb's Law|Coulomb]]

[[Equilibrium Constant]] can be then found
When $E^{\circ} > 0, \Delta G^{\circ} < 0, K > 1$
Thermodynamically favored or vice versa
