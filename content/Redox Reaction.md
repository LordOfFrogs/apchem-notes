A reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between chemical species. 
Some species undergo oxidation (loss of electrons), and others undergo reduction (gain of electrons)
Reduction reduces [[#Oxidation numbers|oxidation number]]
Oxidation increases [[#Oxidation numbers|oxidation number]]
# Oxidation numbers
Charge an atom would have if all [[Bonds]] were [[Ions|ionic]]
Similar to [[Formal Charge]], but assigns electrons in [[Bonds]] to more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] atom
>[!note]
>Oxidation numbers are written with +/- first, whereas [[Ions]] have the sign after the charge
## Guidelines
Free element element: 0
Monoatomic [[Ions|ion]]: charge of [[Ions|ion]]
When in compounds:
Alkali [[Metals]]: +1
Alkaline earth [[Metals]]: +2
Fluorine: -1
Hydrogen: +1 usually, except when combined with [[Metals]] -1
Oxygen: -2, except in peroxides -1
Other halogens: -1, unless with oxygen or fluorine
**The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in neutral compound is 0**
**The sum in a polyatomic [[Ions|ion]] is equal to charge of the [[Ions|ion]]**
# Balancing
Divide reaction into 2 half-reactions, one for oxidation, one for reduction
Add electrons to equations to balance charge
Multiply to get electrons equivalent in equations
Add the reactions together
