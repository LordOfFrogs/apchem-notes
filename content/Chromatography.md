# Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
Measures [[Polarity]]
Retention factor: $R_f=$Distance traveled by [[Mixtures#Solute|solute]] / distance traveled by [[Mixtures#Solvent|solvent]] from origin
Mobile phase - liquid
Stationary phase - gel
![[Thin-layer-chromatography.webp|600]]

## Procedure
Put substance in very [[Polarity|polar]] silica gel
Put one end of gel in less [[Polarity|polar]] [[Mixtures#Solvent|solvent]]
More [[Polarity|polar]] substances more attracted to gel so they travel less
Less [[Polarity|polar]] substances less attracted to gel so they travel more
# Column Chromatography
Fill tube with stationary phase (very [[Polarity|polar]], often silica gel)
Put sample on top
Put mobile phase/[[Mixtures#Solvent|solvent]] on top of sample
Mobile phase pulled down by gravity
