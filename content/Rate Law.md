$$ rate=k[A]^n $$
k is proportionality constant, n is the order of the reaction with respect to a
Overall order of reaction is orders of reactants added together
# Integrated for first order
$$ \ln{[A]_t} = -kt + \ln{[A]_0}$$
$$ [A]_t = [A]_0 e^{-kt} $$
## Half-life
$$ t_{1/2}=-\frac{\ln{\frac{1}{2}}}{k}=\frac{0.693}{k} $$
# Second order [[Integral|integration]]
$$ \frac{1}{[A]_t}=kt+\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$
# Zero order [[Integral|integration]]
$$ [A]_t=-kt+[A]_0 $$
# With [[Elementary Reactions|elementary steps]]:
Build rate law from rate determining step, substitute with fast equilibriums
