Defined by the [[Boltzmann Equation]]
A measure of microstates disorder and dispersal

Increases with:
* volume (more possible positions)
* temperature (range of possible particle speeds/[[Kinetic Energy]] → number of possible [[Microstate|microstates]])
* amount of substance
* phase changes from solid → liquid → gas
Zero defined by [[Third Law of Thermodynamics]]

$$ \Huge \Delta S^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \sum{S^\circ_{\text{(products)}}} - \sum{S^\circ_{\text{(reactants)}}} $$
