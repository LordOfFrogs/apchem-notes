# Enzymes
#bio 
Biological catalyst
Substrate binds to enzyme at active cite
**Induced fit model**: combined enzyme and substrate
# Homogeneous Catalyst
Catalyst present in same phase as reactants in a reaction [[Mixtures|mixture]]
# Heterogeneous Catalyst
Catalyst present in different phase than reactants in [[Mixtures|mixture]]
