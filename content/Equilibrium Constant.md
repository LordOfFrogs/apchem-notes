Proportion of relative amounts of reaction species at equilibrium
For $aA+bB\rightleftharpoons cC+dD$:
$$ K_c=\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b} $$
The subscript c states that it is referring to [[Mixtures#Molarity|concentrations]] at equilibrium
For partial pressures:
$$ K_p=\frac{(P_C)^c(P_D)^d}{(P_A)^a(P_B)^b} $$
Large equilibrium constant (>1): more products than reactants
Small equilibrium constant (<1): more reactants than products

Reverse reaction: equilibrium constant inverted
Multiply reaction by number: equilibrium constant raised to number
Multiple equations added: equilibrium constants multiplied together
# Reaction quotient
$Q_c$ or $Q_p$ same as $K_c$ and $K_p$ but concentrations/pressures are measured at a specific point in time
If reaction quotient = equilibrium constant, then the system is in equilibrium
Q<K → Reaction proceeds towards products
Q>K → Reaction proceeds towards reactants
# [[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|Solubility]] Equilibrium
$$ Salt \rightleftharpoons aA+bB $$
$$ K_{sp}=[A]^a[B]^b $$
$K_{sp}$ < 1 → not very soluble
$K_{sp}$ > 1 → more soluble
$$ \text{Solubility}=x $$
$$ K_{sp}=(ax)^a(bx)^b=a^a b^b x^{a+b} $$
$$ x=\sqrt[a+b]{\frac{K_{sp}}{a^ab^b}} $$
Q < K → undersaturated, no precipitate
Q > K → oversaturated [[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|solution]], precipitate will form until Q=K
## pH
Add H+ [[Ions]] → pH goes down → H+ [[Bonds]] with [[Base|basic]] [[Ions|anions]] → more precipitate dissolves
# Autoionization of Water
In: 
$$ H_2O+H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^++OH^- $$
$$ K_w=[H_3O^+][OH^-]=1.0 \times 10^{-14} \text{ at } 25\celsius $$ Alternatively: 
$$ H_2O \rightleftharpoons H^++OH^- \text{, considering } H^+=H_3O^+ $$
