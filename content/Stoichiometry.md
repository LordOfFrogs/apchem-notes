Numerical relationships between reactants and products
# Mole Ratio
Relates amount of [[Moles]] in chemical reaction
Ratios of coefficients:
$$ \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)+2\text{Al}(s) \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}(l)+\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3(s) $$
$$ 1 \text{ mol Fe}_2\text{O}_3 : 2 \text{ mol Al} $$
# Limiting reactant
A reactant in a chemical reaction that limits the amount of product
# Theoretical yield
Amount of product formed when the [[#limiting reactant]] is fully consumed
# Percent yield
$$ \text{Percent yield}=\frac{\text{actual yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}}\times100\%$$
