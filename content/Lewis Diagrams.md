Way of visualizing molecules
1. Find # of total [[Shells and Electron Configuration#Valence Electrons|valence electrons]]
2. Put most [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] atom in center (besides H)
3. Draw in other atoms
4. Start with single [[Bonds]]
5. Add in extra electrons
6. If central atom doesn't have an octet, create multiple [[Bonds]]
# Octet rule exceptions
H duet rule
B and Al stable with 6
Later elements can have more (eg. Xe)
# Resonance
There can be multiple valid Lewis structures ($NO_3^-$)
In reality form "mix" between different structures
More contributing structure is the one with the [[Formal Charge]]s of atoms closest to 0, and any negative [[Formal Charge]] on most electronegative atom(s)
