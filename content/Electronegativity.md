When atom is in covalent bond, measures attraction of electrons in the bond
Increases with [[Electron Affinity|electron affinity]], therefore across period
Decreases down group because of increased shielding 
Example: $H_2 O$
O is more electronegative than H, so - charge on O side and + charge on H side
