$$ \Huge{ k=Ae^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}} } $$
k: [[Reaction Rate]] constant in [[Rate Law]]
A: frequency/pre-exponential factor - includes frequency and orientation of [[Collision Theory|collisions]]
$e^\frac{-E_a}{RT}=f$: fraction of collisions with enough energy for reaction to occur
$E_a$: activation energy ([[Collision Theory]])
R: [[Ideal Gas Law|ideal gas constant]]
T: temperature
