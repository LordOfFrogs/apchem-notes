**Ideal Gas** - Particles don't interact and don't take up volume
$$ PV=nRT $$
V - volume
P - pressure
T - temperature
n - number of [[Moles]]
R - ideal gas constant 
	$8.314 \text{ J mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}$
	$0.08206 \text{ L atm mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}$
	$62.36 \text{ L Torr mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}$
# [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]'s Law: $V \propto \frac{1}{P}$
# Gay-Lussac's Law: $P \propto T$
# Charles's Law: $V \propto T$
# Avogadro's Law: $V \propto n$
# Dalton's Law: $P_1+P_2=P$

# Ideal vs real gas
Real gases can take up non-negligible volume relative to container
Molecules interact with each other
## Eg.
Low temp, large volume -> particles attracted to each other and start to phase change -> lower pressure than expected
High temp, small volume -> effective volume, accounting for volume of particles, even smaller -> higher pressure than expected
