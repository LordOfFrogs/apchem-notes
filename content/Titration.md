Drip substance that will react with substance of unknown concentration and use some kind of indicator to check if the reaction is still ongoing 
Measure change in volume, convert to [[Moles]] of substance dripped
Measure starting amount of substance with [[Moles|mole]] ratio
Find [[Mixtures#Molarity|molarity]] of substance
# Acid-Base Titration
Measures [[Mixtures#Molarity|molarity]] of [[Acid]]/[[Base]]

Drip known concentration of [[Base]] into [[Acid]] or vise-versa with indicator in unknown amount of substance
End when indicator shows change in acidity (equivalence point)
Choose indicator that changes color around equivalence point
![[Titration-Curves-1-1.png|450]]
## [[Acid#Strong Acid|Strong Acid]]-[[Base#Strong Base|Strong Base]]
Amount of titrant added to get to equivalence point is the amount needed to neutralize the starting analyte
Use to calculate starting concentration
## [[Acid#Weak Acid|Weak Acid]]-[[Base#Strong Base|Strong Base]]
[[pH]] of equivalence point > 7
Half equivalence point is inflection point in graph where $[HA]=[A^-]$
[[Buffer]] [[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|solution]] formed around half equivalence point because [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs|conjugate base]] is formed as the [[Acid#Weak Acid|weak acid]] [[Ions|ionizes]]
## [[Base#Weak Base|Weak Base]]-[[Acid#Strong Acid|Strong Acid]]
[[pH]] of equivalence point < 7
Half equivalence point is where $[B]=[HB^+]$
[[Buffer]] is also formed
## Polyprotic [[Acid]]

Multiple equivalence points and half equivalence points
# Redox Titration
Use [[Redox Reaction]] to measure concentration of substance

Titrate until all of the reactant was used (usually colored reactant that becomes clear when reacted)
