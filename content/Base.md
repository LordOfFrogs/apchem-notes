Proton/$\text{H}^+$ acceptor

**Conjugate base** - Base formed from [[Acid]] donating proton, negative charge
# Strong Base
[[Ions|Ionizes]] completely in water, forming $OH^-$ [[Ions|cations]]
Group 1 (eg. LiOH, NaOH, KOH) and 2 (eg. $Ca(OH)_2, Sr(OH)_2$) [[Metals|metal]] hydroxides
# Weak Base
Partially [[Ions|ionize]] in water to produce hydroxide
[[Equilibrium Constant]] < 1
$K_b$: [[Equilibrium Constant]] when reacted with water
