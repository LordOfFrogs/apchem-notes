A solid formed by [[Ions|ionic]] bonds, forming a crystalline structure
Products of a neutralization reaction between an [[Acid]] and [[Base]], with the [[Ions|cation]] of the [[Base]] and the [[Ions|anion]] of the [[Acid]]
# [[Acid]]-[[Base]] Properties
Generally:
Cation doesn't react with water if it can be found in a [[Base#Strong Base|strong base]]
Anion doesn't react with water if it is the [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs|conjugate base]] to a [[Acid#Strong Acid|strong acid]]

If neither react with water → solution is neutral
Only anion reacts → [[Base]]
Only cation reacts → [[Acid]]
Both react → can be anything, depends on [[Equilibrium Constant]]s of the reactions (which multiply  with [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs]] to get [[Equilibrium Constant#Autoionization of Water|K_w]])
