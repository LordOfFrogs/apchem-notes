# Molecular/Balanced
Any [[Ions|ionic]] compounds are represented as neutral using chemical formulas
$$ \text{AgNO}_3(aq)+\text{NaCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s)+\text{NaNO}_3(aq) $$
# Complete [[Ions|Ionic]]
[[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|Soluble]] [[Ions|ionic]] compounds rewritten as dissociated [[Ions]]
$$ \text{Ag}^+(aq)+\text{NO}_3^-(aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s)+\text{Na}^+(aq)+\text{NO}_3^- $$
# Net [[Ions|Ionic]]
Any spectator [[Ions]] ([[Ions]] that remain unchanged during reaction) are cancelled out
$$ \text{Ag}^+(aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s) $$
## What should be [[Ions|ionized]]
Soluble [[Ions|ionic]] compounds
SNAP - sodium, nitrate, ammonium, potassium (overrides any other rule)
Anything with $\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$ or $\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$
Anything with a group 1 [[Metals|metal]]
Most [[Periodic Table|halogen]] compounds
[[Acid#Strong Acid|Strong acids]]
## NOT usually
Heavy [[Metals]] (Ba, Ag, Hg, Pb) (only [[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|soluble]] with nitrate)
Group 2 [[Metals]] (Ca, Mg, Be)
Carbonates
