Rate = change in concentration / change in time
$$ \bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$
$$ R = \frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} $$
# Factors
## Reactant Concentration
Higher concentration → higher rate of reaction
[[Rate Law]]
## Surface Area
More surface area → more area to react with substance
## Temperature
Higher temperature → faster reaction
## [[Catalyst]]
A substance that increases rate of reaction
