A measure of the amount of hydrogen/hydronium [[Ions|anions]] in a [[Mixtures#Homogeneous/Solutions|solution]] produced by the [[Equilibrium Constant#Autoionization of Water|autoionization of water]]
$$ pH=-\log_{10}[H_3O^+] = -\log_{10}[H^+] $$
pH < 7: [[Acid]]
pH = 7: neutral
pH > 7: [[Base]]

> [!NOTE]
> \# significant figures in concentration â†’ the same \# of digits after decimal place used

> Generally, $pX=-\log_{10}[X]$, e.g. $pOH=-\log_{10}[OH^-]$, so pH+pOH=14
