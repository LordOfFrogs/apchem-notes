Energy emitted when electron is added (-), creating negative [[Ions|ion]]
When adding to new [[Shells and Electron Configuration|energy level]] (or sublevel), energy is required (no affinity)
Increases across period because higher nuclear charge
Adding electron to already occupied orbital also takes energy
