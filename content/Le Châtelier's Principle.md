If a stress is applied to a reaction at equilibrium, the net reaction will go in the direction that decreases the stress
Can be change in amount of substances (will proceed following [[Equilibrium Constant#Reaction quotient|reaction quotient]]])
# Change in volume/temperature
Calculate new pressure(s) with [[Ideal Gas Law]]
Use new pressure(s)/concentration(s) with [[Equilibrium Constant#Reaction quotient|reaction quotient]] to determine how reaction will proceed
More volume → reaction will go in direction that produces more [[Moles]]
Higher temperature → reaction will proceed in direction that consumes heat
