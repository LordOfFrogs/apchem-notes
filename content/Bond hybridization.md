# sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization
4 groups of electrons
Carbon can form 4 [[Bonds]], but by [[Shells and Electron Configuration|electron configuration]] doesn't make sense
2s and 2p orbitals hybridize to form sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals from 1 s and 3 p orbitals
Shaped like lopsided dumbbell, mix between sphere-shaped s and dumbbell-shaped 3
25% s, 75% p
# sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization
3 groups of electrons
Forms 3 sp2 orbitals
33% s, 67% p
Similar shape to [[#sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization|sp3 orbitals]], but with slightly smaller larger lobe
# sp hybridization
2 electron groups
50% s and 50% p character
Similar shape as [[#sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization|sp3]] and [[#sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization|sp2]] orbitals, with even shorter lobe
