Random [[Dipole]] in atom induces [[Dipole]] in neighboring atom
Larger atom/molecule -> Larger electron clouds -> higher [[Polarity|polarizability]] -> higher dispersion forces
Larger surface area in molecule also increases force
Affects boiling point with higher force = higher boiling point because higher forces must be overcome by temperature
