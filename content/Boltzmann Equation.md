$$ \Huge S = k \ln{W} $$
S: [[Entropy]]
k: [[#Boltzmann's Constant]]
W: number of [[Microstate|microstates]] in a system (sometimes written as $\Omega$)
# Boltzmann's Constant
$k$ or $k_B$
$$ k = \frac{R}{N_A} = \frac{nR}{N} \approx 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J K}^{-1} $$
R: [[Ideal Gas Law|Ideal gas constant]]
$N_A$: [[Moles|Avogadro's Number]]
n: (from [[Ideal Gas Law]]) number of [[Moles]] of a substance
N: number of particles of gas
