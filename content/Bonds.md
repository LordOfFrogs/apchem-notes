# [[Ions|Ionic]] Bond
One atom "gives" electron to another
Forms [[Ions|cation]] and [[Ions|anion]] that stick together
Caused by attraction between + and - charge
Typically [[Metals]] - non-metal
# Covalent Bond
Share electrons
Each line in [[Molecule Naming|structural formula]] represents sharing a pair of electrons
Can be polar when one side has more [[Electronegativity]]
Typically non-metal - non-metal
[[Electronegativity]] difference causes a spectrum between [[#Covalent Bond]] and [[#Ionic Bond]]
# Metallic Bond
A bunch of metallic atoms that all share a "sea" of electrons
Forms many [[Ions|cations]] that all share electrons
Causes [[Metals|metal]] properties
# Bond Length and Energy
Usually measuring covalent bonds
![[H-potE.svg]]
Minimum potential energy dictates stable bond length
Bond energy is the energy it takes to separate bond
Higher order bonds - higher energy
Graphed with bond length on x axis in pm, PE on y axis in kJ/mol
# Lattice Energy
Measured in kJ/mol
Typically [[Ions#Ionic Solids|ionic solids]]
Smaller bonds = higher lattice energy
